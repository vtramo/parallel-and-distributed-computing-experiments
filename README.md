# Parallel & Distributed Computing Experiments
Programs written in C with [OpenMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/)

Resolution and testing of the following parallel and distributed computing problems:
- **parallel-sum** with different strategies
- **parallel-vector-matrix-product** with OpenMPI
- **parallel-vector-matrix-product-openmp** with OpenMP
- **broadcast-multiply-rolling** with OpenMPI
